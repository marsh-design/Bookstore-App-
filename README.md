# Bookstore-App-
A desktop application built using Java and JavaFX for my Object Oriented Programming Class.

Description
This project was developed to create a Bookstore App that allows users to purchase books and enables administrators to update and track book inventory. The app also has a customer database where administrators can view and modify customer details.

The app is built using Java and JavaFX for the GUI, and makes use of object-oriented programming concepts to create book and customer objects. The state design pattern is also applied to change the member status of a customer.

The app has a single-window GUI, where multiple screens are displayed in the same window. When the user clicks the exit button, all relevant data is written to the books.txt and customers.txt files, and when the app is started, the data from these files is loaded into the app's data structures.

There are two types of users in the app: Owner and Customer. The app starts with a login screen, where the owner's username is admin and password is admin.
